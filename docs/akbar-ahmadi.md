### **About Me**

I am a dedicated **Software Architect** and **Senior Developer** with **8 years** of experience in designing, building, and maintaining software solutions across a diverse range of technologies. My expertise lies in **software architecture**, where I specialize in creating scalable, modular, and efficient systems tailored to meet business needs.

I have extensive experience with **microservices architecture**, as well as **modular monolithic design**, striking the right balance between scalability, maintainability, and development speed. My approach emphasizes practical solutions that leverage **cutting-edge architectural patterns** and industry best practices to deliver robust and high-quality software.

In addition, my skills in **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, and **SOLID principles** enable me to create software that is highly cohesive, loosely coupled, and easy to maintain.

### **Architectural Philosophy: Microservices vs. Modular Monolithic**

I approach system architecture with a pragmatic mindset, carefully selecting between **Microservices** and **Modular Monolithic** architectures based on the project's requirements, scalability demands, and complexity.

- **Microservices** are ideal for large, **highly scalable**, distributed applications that require **independent deployment** and **domain isolation**. They offer flexibility and resilience, enabling teams to manage different parts of the system autonomously.

- **Modular Monolithic** architecture, on the other hand, is highly suitable for projects at an early stage, providing a simpler path to **maintainability** and **development speed**. Modular monolithic solutions emphasize clean separation of concerns, which ensures that codebases remain organized and evolve predictably while avoiding the operational overhead of microservices.

In practice, I often advocate for starting with a **modular monolithic** approach—keeping the architecture clean and divided into logical modules. This approach allows for reduced complexity and improved developer velocity. As the application grows and scaling requirements emerge, transitioning to a **microservices** model can provide the scalability and flexibility needed.
