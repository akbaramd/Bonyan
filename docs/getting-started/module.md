# Module Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the module architecture in **Bonyan.AspNetCore**. It delves into the theoretical underpinnings and practical implementation of modules, lifecycle management, and the usage of the `DependOn` method for inter-module dependency management.

## Concept of a Module

A **Module** in **Bonyan.AspNetCore** represents a fundamental building block designed to encapsulate discrete functionality within the application. This modular design fosters a strict separation of concerns, facilitating the creation of highly maintainable and well-organized software systems. The modular approach is particularly advantageous in monolithic architectures, where clear delineation of responsibilities significantly mitigates complexity.

Each module is equipped with a series of lifecycle hooks, which can be overridden to tailor the behavior of the module across different stages of the application's configuration and operation. These lifecycle hooks are instrumental in allowing precise control over application behavior during setup, initialization, and beyond.

## Lifecycle Phases of a Module

Modules in **Bonyan** can override specific lifecycle methods to orchestrate their behavior throughout different phases of application execution:

### Configuration Lifecycle

1. **OnPreConfigureAsync**: This method is invoked before the commencement of the configuration process, making it suitable for setting up preliminary tasks that the module may require prior to configuring services.
2. **OnConfigureAsync**: The primary configuration method where the module sets up its services and customizes the application's dependency injection container. This is a critical point for defining service behavior and dependency management.
3. **OnPostConfigureAsync**: This method is executed upon the completion of the configuration process, enabling actions that require all prior configurations to be in place, such as validation of configuration settings or performing logging operations.

### Initialization Lifecycle

1. **OnPreInitializeAsync**: This method is invoked before the initialization phase begins, allowing preparatory actions that need to be in place before core initialization tasks.
2. **OnInitializeAsync**: This is the main method responsible for initializing the module. It encompasses activities such as registering required resources, setting up listeners, or executing essential startup procedures.
3. **OnPostInitializeAsync**: Invoked after the core initialization process, this method allows the finalization of setup tasks that are contingent on the completion of the initialization.

These lifecycle methods provide a robust framework for developers, affording them precise entry points to insert custom logic during various phases of the application's execution.

## Managing Dependencies Between Modules

Modules in **Bonyan.AspNetCore** can be composed in a way that allows for explicit dependency relationships between them, ensuring that all required modules are loaded in the correct sequence. This is accomplished using the `DependOn<T>` method, which helps maintain a clear and logical modular dependency hierarchy.

### Example: Defining Module Dependencies

```csharp
public class YourMainModule : Module
{
    public YourMainModule()
    {
        DependOn<YourAnotherModule>();
        DependOn<YourAnotherModule2>();
    }

    public override Task OnConfigureAsync(ServiceConfigurationContext context)
    {
        // Core configuration logic here
        return base.OnConfigureAsync(context);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **DependOn<T>**: The `DependOn` method declares that the current module has an explicit dependency on another module (`YourAnotherModule` or `YourAnotherModule2`). This ensures that these dependent modules are initialized and configured before the current module begins its own setup.
- Importantly, the **entry point module** is executed last, meaning all dependent modules are fully configured before the entry point module begins its lifecycle processes. This approach ensures a predictable and reliable order of operations, where all dependencies are available when required.
- The dependency management provided by `DependOn<T>` is essential for maintaining correct module initialization order, ensuring that all prerequisites are satisfied before execution proceeds, which ultimately fosters a more predictable and resilient application structure.

## Role of Modules in Monolithic Modularity

In the context of **monolithic modularity**, modules serve as well-defined, independent components that encapsulate distinct pieces of functionality within a larger monolithic architecture. This modular approach ensures that even in a monolithic structure, the application remains organized, maintainable, and scalable.

Modules in **Bonyan.AspNetCore** provide clear boundaries within the application, each handling a specific domain or functionality. By leveraging lifecycle methods and dependencies, modules can be composed to form a cohesive whole without sacrificing the modularity and independence of each part. This enables developers to achieve a level of modularity that is often associated with microservices, but within a single deployable unit, thereby simplifying deployment and reducing operational overhead.

The ability to depend on other modules allows for a hierarchy where lower-level foundational modules are configured and initialized before higher-level modules, thus ensuring stability and reducing coupling between different parts of the system. This approach makes **Bonyan.AspNetCore** highly suitable for developing large-scale, monolithic applications that require both modular flexibility and unified deployment.

## Summary

The module system in **Bonyan.AspNetCore** underpins a highly maintainable and scalable architecture, particularly suited for complex monolithic applications. Modules encapsulate discrete pieces of functionality, each governed by distinct lifecycle methods that afford precise control over configuration and initialization.

The `DependOn<T>` mechanism ensures that modules are initialized in a coherent and logical order, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity and predictability of the application. By leveraging this modular approach, **Bonyan.AspNetCore** facilitates the construction of clean, extensible, and maintainable software architectures within the scope of a monolithic application.
