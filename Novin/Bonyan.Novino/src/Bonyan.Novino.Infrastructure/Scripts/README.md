# Database Scripts Directory

This directory contains all database-related SQL scripts generated by Entity Framework migrations.

## Script Types

- **Migration Scripts**: Idempotent SQL scripts for database migrations
- **Deployment Scripts**: Production-ready scripts with safety checks
- **Seed Scripts**: Data seeding scripts for initial setup

## File Naming Convention

- `migration-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.sql` - Timestamped migration scripts
- `deployment-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.sql` - Timestamped deployment scripts
- `seed-initial-data.sql` - Initial data seeding scripts

## Usage

Scripts in this directory are automatically generated by the migration system and should not be manually edited. They are used for:

1. **Development**: Testing migrations locally
2. **Staging**: Validating migrations before production
3. **Production**: Safe database deployments

## Script Generation

Scripts are generated using the PowerShell scripts in the root `scripts/` directory:

```powershell
# Generate migration script
.\scripts\migrate-database.ps1 -Script

# Generate deployment script
.\scripts\generate-migration-script.ps1 -OutputFile "Scripts/production-migration.sql"
```
